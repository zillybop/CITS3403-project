      Welcome to the Computer Vision Toolkit â€” a simple, modular web application for 
      exploring common computer vision techniques. Use the navigation bar above to try 
      out visualisation tools, image enhancement, thresholding, and more.

    <p>
      You can either <span class="badge bg-primary">Upload</span> your own images or use our 
      <span class="badge bg-success">Generated</span> samples to explore various features. 
      Uploaded images are shown with a blue badge, while generated ones are marked in green.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our <strong>Edge Detection</strong> tool lets you apply Sobel, Laplacian, and Canny 
      filters to highlight object boundaries. The <strong>Visualiser</strong> lets you 
      inspect image histograms and color channels interactively.
