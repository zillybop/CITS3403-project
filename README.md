# CITS3403-project

# Purpose:
a description of the purpose of the application, explaining its design and use.
- The purpose of this application is to provide a web-based image processing tool that allows users to upload images, apply various image processing techniques, and share the results with others. The application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it easy for anyone to perform image processing tasks without needing extensive technical knowledge.
- The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python, and utilises various image processing libraries to perform tasks such as black and white conversion, edge detection, and connected components analysis. Users can upload images, apply the desired processing techniques, and then share the processed images with others in some way (TBD)

## Tools
- First: Black and white conversion
- Potential enhancements:
    - Edge detection
    - Connected components
